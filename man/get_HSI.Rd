\title{Calculate Habitat Suitability Index (HSI)}
\usage{
get_HSI(surveydata, MapData, envVariable, Seasons, int_n, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{surveydata}{A dataframe containing abundance and environmental data.}

\item{MapData}{A dataframe with spatial environmental variable information (latitude, longitude, depth, SST, etc.).}

\item{envVariable}{A character vector of environmental variable names.}

\item{Seasons}{Character vector of seasons (e.g. "Spring", "Fall").}

\item{int_n}{Number of intervals/bins for SI curve.}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector of weights for each environmental variable (must sum to 1).}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing calculated HSI values.
}
\description{
This function calculates habitat suitability indices (HSI)
based on survey data and environmental variables.
